# 🌿 Welcome to Echo & Brackets – VS Code Extension

Your workspace just got lyrical. This folder contains the full working structure for the **Echo & Brackets** extension — a poetic enhancement that delivers floating echos and sidebar verse magic into your dev flow.

---

## 📁 What's Inside

- `package.json` — The manifest that defines the extension name, commands, contributions, and activation logic.
- `src/extension.ts` — The heart of your extension. This is where the poetry is born and the magic is triggered.
- `media/` — Holds styles and scripts for your custom webviews (floating poem and sidebar).
- `images/` — (Optional) Store screenshots or GIFs here for the README and Marketplace preview.
- `.vscode/` — Workspace-specific settings for debugging, formatting, and linting.
- `test/` — Contains unit tests to ensure your poetry doesn’t break.

## ⚙️ Setup

To get started and contribute:

1. Clone the repo and open in VS Code.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Install the recommended extensions when prompted:
   - `amodio.tsl-problem-matcher`

- Press `F5` to open a **new Extension Development Host** window.
- Use `Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` → run the command `Toggle Echo & Brackets Sidebar`.

## 🧪 Test Your Extension

Testing poetry? Yes — it’s still code! You can:

- Install [Extension Test Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.extension-test-runner).
- Run `Tasks: Run Task → watch`.
- Use the **Testing** panel to run tests or use the shortcut: `Ctrl+; A`.
- Modify or add test files inside `/test/`. Files should match the pattern `*.test.ts`.
