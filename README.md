# 🌸 Echo & Brackets

_Echoes of code. Whispers of poetry. A echo awaits every save._

**Echo & Brackets** is a whimsical VS Code extension that transforms your coding sessions into poetic moments. Whether you’re debugging chaos or smashing out a feature, this extension surprises you with a floating echo panel and a cozy sidebar filled with verse.

> Because sometimes… the compiler isn’t the only thing that needs a soft word.
